Extract all original phpBB files into this directory.
Then do a

    git checkout .

inside this directory to replace some phpBB files by our modified versions.
Other than that, no files must be modified except for settings!

The subdirectories resemble parts of the phpBB directory structure and contain our modules and skins.
